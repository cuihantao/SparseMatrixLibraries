# Usage Examples for Sparse Matrix Libraries

As an outgrowth of some debugging I've been doing I made test cases of the same problem with several different libraries:

* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialSparse.html)
* [CSparse](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
* [SuiteSparse](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html)

It seemed like a good idea to upload these test cases for public reference.
